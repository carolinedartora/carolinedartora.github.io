As a physicist with a passion for understanding human brain function and its implications on healthy aging and cognitive decline, I've developed expertise in using medical imaging techniques to analyze and model brain health. :brain:
Currently working as a postdoctoral researcher :woman_scientis: at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, I'm applying deep learning methods to develop novel brain age modeling approaches. With a strong foundation in biomedical gerontology (PhD), biomedical engineering (MSc) and medical physics (BSc), along with clinical experience in radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiotherapy departments, I bring a unique blend of skills to the field.
